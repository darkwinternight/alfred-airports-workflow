A workflow for [Alfred 3](http://www.alfredapp.com) that allows you to search for airports and display some information about them.

## Installation

Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/darkwinternight/alfred-airports-workflow/releases) page and double click the downloaded file to install it.

The workflow supports automatic updates.

## Usage

When hitting `⏎ Return` on a selected item, the workflow tries to be helpful by opening either the airports website or its Wikpedia page if it has one. If it has neither a website nor an entry in Wikipedia, it opens the Apple Maps.app with the location of the airport.

When holding down a modifier key, the action can be specified:

| Modifier | Action                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `⌥`     | Open the website of the selected airport.        |
| `ctrl`   | Open the Wikipedia page of the selected airport. |
| `⌘`     | Show the airports location in Maps.app           |
