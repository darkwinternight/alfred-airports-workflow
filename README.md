A workflow for [Alfred 3](http://www.alfredapp.com) that provides quick access to information about all airports in the world.

The latest version can be found here as well:

* http://www.packal.org/workflow/airports

## Installation

Download the latest version of the `airports.alfredworkflow` from the [Releases](https://github.com/otherguy/alfred-airports-workflow/releases) page and double click the downloaded file to install it.

The workflow supports automatic updates and will perform daily update checks.

## Usage

When hitting `‚èé Return` on a selected item, the workflow tries to be helpful by opening either the airports website or its Wikipedia page if it has one. If it has neither a website nor an entry in Wikipedia, it opens the Apple Maps.app with the location of the airport.

When holding down a modifier key, the action can be specified:

| Modifier | Action                                           |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `‚å•`      | Open the website of the selected airport.        |
| `ctrl`   | Open the Wikipedia page of the selected airport. |
| `‚åò`      | Show the airports location in Maps.app           |

Since version `0.1.4`, you can search for ICAO codes as well.

You can install `jq` from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and pipe the output of the workflow through this program to get nice formatting and the option to query the JSON.
